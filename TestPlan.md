### Test Plan for Shopping Management System

#### Objective:
To validate the functionality of the Shopping Management System, particularly the ShoppingManager.

#### Test Scenarios:

1. *Adding Products:*
    - *Test Data:* Create various products (electronics and clothing) with different attributes (ID, name, available items, price, etc.).
    - *Test Steps:*
        - Add Electronics and Clothing products using the "Add Product" functionality.
        - Ensure the products are added successfully by verifying their existence in the product list.
        - Check the product attributes for accuracy.

2. *Removing Products:*
    - *Test Data:* Use existing product IDs for removal.
    - *Test Steps:*
        - Remove a product from the list using the "Remove Product" functionality.
        - Verify that the removed products are no longer present in the product list.


3. *Retrieving Products:*
    - *Test Data:* Different product IDs to fetch specific products.
    - *Test Steps:*
        - Retrieve individual products using their IDs.
        - Verify that the retrieved products match the expected attributes.
        - Fetch products based on type (Electronics/Clothing) and ensure correct categorization.

4. *Saving and Loading:*
    - *Test Steps:*
        - Save the current product list to a file.
        - Check that the saved file exists.

#### Test Environment and Conditions:
- Use different combinations of product attributes to cover various scenarios.
- Simulate edge cases (maximum products limit, empty list, etc.) to ensure robustness.

#### Expected Results:
- Products should be added, removed, and retrieved accurately.
- Saving and loading should preserve the integrity of the product data.

#### Conclusion:
- All tests should pass without errors or discrepancies, ensuring the functionality and reliability of the Shopping Management System.
